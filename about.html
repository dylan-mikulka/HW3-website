                <h3>How It All Began</h3>
                <p>
                    I've been fishing for as long as I can remember. My family jokes that I had a 
                    rod in my hand before I could even walk properly. But my real journey with 
                    fly-fishing began when I was nine years old. My grandfather took me out to a 
                    small stream and taught me how to cast. I still remember the feel of the rod, 
                    the rhythm of the line in the air, and the excitement of my first trout on a 
                    fly. From that moment on, I was hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every summer growing up, I would go on weekly fishing trips with my grandparents. 
                    We'd load up the old Oldtown canoe and paddle out into the rivers and lakes of 
                    Maine, searching for smallmouth bass. Those long days on the water, with nothing 
                    but the sound of paddles dipping and the occasional splash of a fish, are some 
                    of my most cherished memories. My grandparents taught me more than just how to 
                    fish. They taught me patience, respect for nature, and the value of simply being 
                    outdoors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These days, my focus has shifted to wading the rivers of northern Maine with my 
                    father. We target brook trout and landlocked salmon in cold, clear streams that 
                    wind through dense forests. But it's never just about the fishing. Every trip is 
                    an opportunity to witness incredible wildlife. I've watched moose feeding along 
                    the banks, bald eagles soaring overhead, and beavers working on their dams. 
                    These encounters remind me why I love this sport so much. It's about being part 
                    of something larger.

                    The last two summers, my dad and I took on a different kind of project. We spent 
                    our time off the grid in northern Maine, building a cabin from the ground up. 
                    Working with our hands, sleeping under the stars, and living without modern 
                    conveniences brought me even closer to the wild places I love. That cabin now 
                    serves as our base camp for fishing adventures, a place where we can disconnect 
                    from everything and just be in nature.
